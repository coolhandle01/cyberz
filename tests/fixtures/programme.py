"""Programme / scope / run-directory fixtures.

``programme`` is the canonical in-scope ``Programme`` (``*.example.com``
wildcard + ``https://example.com`` URL). ``programme_in_workspace``
stages it into the test rundir as ``programme.json`` so
``current_programme()`` resolves end-to-end - tests that exercise any
``@cyber_tool`` with a ``Target*`` typed-target field take this fixture
so the args_schema scope-validator has a programme to consult.

``dvwa_*`` mirrors the same shape pointing at Damn Vulnerable Web
Application on localhost; reserved for the DVWA-sandbox e2e work in
#121 Phase 3.

Loaded via ``pytest_plugins`` in ``tests/conftest.py``.
