"""HTTP-response fixtures.

``make_response`` is the canonical mock-Response factory - use it
instead of hand-rolling ``MagicMock(); resp.status_code = ...; resp.text
= ...`` at every probe test. ``clean_response_body`` is an HTML body
verified at setup time to contain no pentest probe marker; use it for
"nothing of interest in the response" cases so an unlucky literal
does not trip an unrelated probe's detection.

Loaded via ``pytest_plugins`` in ``tests/conftest.py``.
