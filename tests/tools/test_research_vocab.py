"""
tests/tools/test_research_vocab.py - unit tests for tools/research_vocab.py.

The vocab module is two lists plus a small docstring-composition helper. The
agent-visible docstring of ``Finalise Research`` is built from these lists at
decoration time, so the tests guard two contracts:

* The registries carry today's baseline (CVE / vulnerability-class for probes;
  host / tech / port / endpoint for recon evidence). Removing one is a breaking
  change to the agent prompt.
* ``compose_research_brief_doc`` weaves every registered entry into the
  composed docstring, and an appended entry (simulating a future #88 / #45 PR)
  also lands without further edits.
