"""squad/workspace_tools.py - shared run-workspace surface.

Two halves:

- ``@cyber_tool`` wrappers around the workspace artefact IO (``List
  Run Files``, ``Read Run File``, ``Read Attack Plan``).
- ``current_programme()`` - the shared programme-loader used by every
  agent (and by ``@cyber_tool(scope_filter=...)``) that needs the
  parsed ``Programme`` to reason against. Reads from
  ``<run_dir>/programme.json`` - the snapshot the Programme Manager's
  ``Save Selected Programme`` tool writes at the top of every run.
  No H1 API call: the workspace is the authoritative source once a
  programme has been selected.
