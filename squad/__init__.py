"""
squad/__init__.py - shared SquadMember dataclass + agent/task builders.

Each sub-package declares one module-level ``MEMBER = SquadMember(...)`` constant.
Agent prose lives in three markdown files alongside it:

    role.md   goal.md   backstory.md

Task-specific prose lives in named subdirectories:

    <task_name>/description.md    <task_name>/expected_output.md

A squad member that appears in more than one pipeline task (e.g. the
Vulnerability Researcher runs as both attack-planner and findings-triager)
has one subdir per task:

    research/description.md   triage/description.md

Member-specialist skills live alongside the prose in a ``skills/`` subdirectory;
each skill is its own folder containing a ``SKILL.md`` with frontmatter, per the
crewai.skills loader contract. Squad-wide skills live at ``squad/skills/`` and
are attached at Crew construction in crew.py.

Assembly (LLM wiring, pipeline order, approval gates) lives in crew.py / tasks.py.

    Project-specific name (rather than e.g. ``CrewAITool``) so the squad's
    public surface stays decoupled from the underlying agent framework:
    today this Protocol matches the runtime shape ``crewai.tools.tool``
    produces, but the registry is "the tools the bounty squad uses", not
    "the tools CrewAI happens to produce". The Protocol stays a real
    abstraction: ``SquadMember.tools: list[SquadTool]`` and the specialist
    Protocols (``_PentestTool``, ``_ResearchBriefTool``) inherit from it
    so the cross-agent contract test in
    ``tests/test_squad_tool_contracts.py`` has a typed handle to walk.

    The decorators in use - the bare ``@tool``, ``@cyber_tool``,
    ``@pentest_tool``, ``@research_brief_tool`` - all produce CrewAI
    ``Tool`` instances that carry ``name``, ``description``, ``func``,
    and ``args_schema``. ``args_schema`` is part of the Protocol because
    every cybersquad wrapper carries an explicit Pydantic schema; the
    contract tests in ``tests/squad/<agent>/test_args_schemas.py`` walk
    it on every registered tool. ``func`` is declared via ``@property``
    (rather than as a plain class attribute) so the Protocol is
    satisfied by CrewAI's ``Tool`` model - its ``func`` field is typed
    ``Callable[P, R | Awaitable[R]]`` for the concrete wrapped function
    and would otherwise fail Protocol variance against
    ``Callable[..., object]``.

    schema CrewAI would otherwise build. Every cybersquad ``@tool``
    wrapper carries one - the inferred path is not reachable anywhere
    in the squad. Per-field ``Field(description=...)`` is the targeting
    guidance the agent reads when picking the tool.

    Scope safety is a Pydantic-native property of the args_schema, not
    of this decorator: agent-facing target fields are typed via the
    ``TargetFQDNs`` / ``TargetEndpoints`` (list, filter) or
    ``TargetFQDN`` / ``TargetEndpoint`` (single, reject) aliases
    in ``tools.recon.scope``. The ``AfterValidator`` on each alias
    consults ``current_programme()`` during
    ``args_schema.model_validate(...)`` - CrewAI's tool-call path runs
    that validation before the wrapper body sees any input. The type
