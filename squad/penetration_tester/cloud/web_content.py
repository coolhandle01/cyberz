"""
Web-content exposure probes - HTTP path checks against agent-picked
endpoints. ``Sensitive Files Check`` looks for env / config / backups
/ VCS metadata / build artefacts served unintentionally;
``Admin Panels Check`` looks for admin-panel login pages at predictable
paths. Both take ``list[Endpoint]``; the wrapper-level scope filter
drops endpoints whose host is outside the selected programme's
structured scope before the probe fires.
