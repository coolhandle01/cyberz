    Probe ID-shaped URL path segments and parameters for Insecure Direct
    Object Reference (IDOR) - the most-rewarded class on HackerOne (OWASP A01).

    Numeric path segments (e.g. /users/12345) and ID-shaped parameters (id,
    user_id, account_id, order_id, ...) are probed using the selected attack
    strategies (omit or pass null to run all three):

      sequential    - neighbour IDs: value-1, value+1, value-100 (numeric path
                      segments where the current value is visible in the URL).
                      For query parameters where no current value is known,
                      probes 1 and 2 instead.
      boundary      - 0 and -1; catches missing lower-bound checks.
      type-juggling - 1.0, 1e1, 01; targets backends that accept loose numeric
                      input and may bypass strict access-control comparisons.

    Detection signals:
      HIGH   - status changes from 401/403 to 200 (access-control bypass)
      HIGH   - 200 response body contains a PII pattern (email, sensitive key)
      MEDIUM - unexpected 200 for boundary ID (id=0 or id=-1)

    endpoints: list of endpoint objects. Prioritise endpoints where:
      - The URL path includes numeric segments (/api/users/42, /orders/9)
      - Parameters include id, user_id, account_id, order_id, or similar
      - The endpoint handles authenticated or per-user data
      Example: [{"url": "https://example.com/api/users/42", "status_code": 200}]

    Use attacks=["boundary"] for a quiet reconnaissance pass (2 requests per
    candidate). Use attacks=["sequential"] when you already know an ID and want
    to probe adjacent objects. Use all three (default) for maximum coverage.

    One finding per endpoint; stops after the first confirming probe. Does not
    brute-force ID ranges.
