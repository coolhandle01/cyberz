    Inject an angle-bracket canary into request headers and check whether the
    response body contains the canary verbatim (unencoded).

    Unencoded reflection confirms the application echoes raw header values into
    HTML output without sanitisation, which is sufficient evidence of a Header
    XSS vulnerability (H1 weakness: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for
    Scripting Syntax).

    Use when:
      - The target renders content server-side (templates, SSR, admin dashboards)
      - Error pages are verbose and likely to echo request metadata
      - Recon found analytics or logging endpoints that display User-Agent strings
      - The target is an older web application (PHP, JSP, ASP) with legacy templating

    endpoints: list of endpoint objects. Pass a broad set of live
      HTML-serving endpoints; error pages and admin paths are especially fruitful.
      Example: [{"url": "https://example.com/error", "status_code": 404}]

    header_names: optional list of headers to probe; omit or pass null to test
      all five. Narrow this when recon evidence points to a specific header
