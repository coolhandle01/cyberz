    Detect CSRF vulnerabilities across HTML endpoints in the recon surface.

    Tier 1 (MEDIUM): fetches each HTML endpoint and checks for page-level
    CSRF protection before inspecting forms.  When the response sets a
    CSRF-pattern cookie (Angular XSRF-TOKEN, Django csrftoken, Tornado _xsrf)
    or the HTML contains a <meta name="csrf-token"> tag (Rails, Spring), the
    missing-input finding is suppressed - those frameworks protect POSTs via JS
    without hidden form inputs.  For other pages, any POST form with no hidden
    input matching a CSRF token name pattern is flagged.

    Tier 2 (HIGH): POSTs to the form action with an evil Origin header and
    with the correct Origin.  Runs against every endpoint with a POST form,
    including those where Tier 1 was suppressed, because per-view bypasses
    (Django @csrf_exempt, Rails skip_before_action, Spring csrf().disable(),
    Laravel $except) mean a page-level cookie or meta tag cannot be trusted
    to cover every route.  When Tier 2 fires on a page-protected endpoint the
    evidence names the likely bypass pattern so the agent can report it
    accurately.
