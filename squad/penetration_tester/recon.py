squad/penetration_tester/recon.py - typed slicers over the OSINT
Analyst's ``recon.json``.

The PT does not run recon itself - the OA produced ``recon.json`` -
but it needs narrow views (subdomain list, filtered endpoint page,
per-host port map) to choose which probes to run without loading the
whole AttackSurface. These three @cyber_tool wrappers are those typed
slicers. They are read-only, idempotent, and write nothing to the
workspace.
