"""
squad/osint_analyst/enrichment.py - the OSINT post-sweep pivot surface.

Where ``discovery.py`` answers "what is the attack surface" (the sweep
and the slicers over it), this module carries the tools the OA reaches
for *after* the sweep to enrich and pivot on what it surfaced:

- ``Lookup IP Assets`` - ASN + RDAP + PTR for IPs the sweep surfaced,
  composed into the faithful OAM ``IpEnrichment`` subgraph (IPAddress /
  Netblock / AutonomousSystem nodes + registry / registrant assets + edges).

These are the "explore, don't just record" half: the sweep records the
surface; these tools let the agent follow a thread off it with
judgement. The ``recon-flow`` skill steers when to reach for each.

No scope filter on the IP-rooted lookups: the programme scope model is
FQDN-shaped, and the IPs the agent passes were surfaced (and
scope-filtered) by the sweep upstream. The filtering lives at the FQDN
boundary, not the IP one - see the per-tool notes below.

    the hostnames that PTR back to each IP.

    Fires outbound lookups per IP: Team Cymru bulk-whois (ASN), RDAP HTTP
    fetches (registrant, per IP and per AS), and a dnsx ``-ptr`` reverse
    query. Each source degrades independently - an IP with only ASN data

    nodes rather than being dropped.
