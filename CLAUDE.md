# Bounty Squad — AI Contributor Guide

This file is for AI assistants working on this codebase. It covers the architecture, conventions, safety invariants, and the things most likely to trip you up.

## What this project does

Bounty Squad is a six-agent CrewAI pipeline that autonomously selects HackerOne bug bounty programmes, maps their attack surface, runs vulnerability scans, triages findings, writes professional disclosure reports, and submits them via the H1 API. Agents run sequentially; each passes structured output to the next via CrewAI's `context` chaining.

---

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | CLI entrypoint. Calls `check_env()` before importing crew — keep it that way. |
| `config.py` | All env-var reading lives here. Singleton: `from config import config`. |
| `models.py` | Pydantic contracts between agents. Change these carefully — they cross agent boundaries. |
| `agents.py` | Agent definitions + `@tool`-decorated wrappers. LLM is `ChatAnthropic`, not a string. |
| `tasks.py` | Loads `prompts/*.md` and wires tasks to agents. Thin — keep it that way. |
| `crew.py` | Assembles the `Crew`. No module-level side effects. |
| `prompts/*.md` | One file per agent role. Split on `\n---\n`: description above, expected output below. |
| `tools/h1_api.py` | HackerOne REST client. Singleton: `from tools.h1_api import h1`. |
| `tools/recon_tools.py` | Wraps subfinder, httpx, nmap. Contains the scope guard. |
| `tools/vuln_tools.py` | Wraps nuclei, sqlmap, custom checks. |
| `tools/report_tools.py` | Renders Markdown reports and writes them to disk. |

## Conventions

### Config

All environment variables are read in `config.py` using `field(default_factory=lambda: ...)`. This is intentional — it means values are read at instantiation time, not at class-definition time, which lets `monkeypatch.setenv()` work correctly in tests. Do not change field defaults to bare expressions.

```python
# correct
max_programmes: int = field(default_factory=lambda: int(os.getenv("H1_MAX_PROGRAMMES", "10")))

# wrong — evaluated once at import time, monkeypatch has no effect
max_programmes: int = int(os.getenv("H1_MAX_PROGRAMMES", "10"))
```

### Models

Use `StrEnum` (not `(str, Enum)`) for string enumerations — ruff rule UP042 enforces this. Use `X | None` not `Optional[X]`. Use `model_copy(update={...})` in tests to create variants.

### Agents

Always construct the LLM explicitly:

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
llm = ChatAnthropic(model=config.llm.model, temperature=config.llm.temperature, max_tokens=config.llm.max_tokens)
```

Passing a model name string to CrewAI's `Agent(llm=...)` silently ignores `temperature` and `max_tokens`.

### Prompts

Each file in `prompts/` must contain exactly one `---` separator on its own line. Everything above is the task `description`; everything below is `expected_output`. The loader in `tasks.py` will raise `ValueError` if the separator is missing.

---

## Safety invariants — do not break these

**Scope enforcement** — `filter_in_scope()` in `recon_tools.py` uses an exact-match or dot-boundary check:

```python
if host == pattern or host.endswith("." + pattern):
```

A bare `host.endswith(pattern)` would allow `evil.notexample.com` to match `example.com`. Do not simplify this.

**Automated-scanning gate** — `parse_programme()` in `h1_api.py` sets `allows_automated_scanning=False` when the policy text contains keywords like "no automated" or "automated scanning prohibited". The Programme Manager is instructed to discard such programmes. Do not remove or weaken this check.

**Import order in `main.py`** — `check_env()` must run before `build_crew()` is imported or called. The crew import triggers `agents.py`, which imports `config`, which reads env vars. If credentials are missing, `check_env()` should exit cleanly before that happens.

**No module-level side effects in `crew.py`** — the old `crew = build_crew()` at module level has been deliberately removed. Do not re-introduce it.

---

## Testing

All tests are marked `@pytest.mark.unit` and must run without network access, real API credentials, or external binaries. Use `monkeypatch` and `unittest.mock` to isolate.

```bash
H1_API_USERNAME=test H1_API_TOKEN=test pytest -m unit
```

Tests that reload modules for config isolation use `importlib.reload()` — this is the correct pattern for testing env-var-backed dataclasses.

Coverage floor is 70%. Every new public function in `tools/` needs a test. Every bug fix needs a regression test.

---

## Adding a new agent

1. Define a new `@tool`-decorated function in `agents.py` (or a new file in `tools/`).
2. Add a new `Agent(...)` entry to `build_agents()` in `agents.py`.
3. Create `prompts/<role-name>.md` with description and expected output separated by `---`.
4. Add a `Task(...)` to `build_tasks()` in `tasks.py`, wiring `context` dependencies.
5. Add the task to the returned list in the correct pipeline position.
6. Add unit tests covering the new tool's logic.

---

## Adding a new config value

1. Add a field to the appropriate dataclass in `config.py` using `default_factory=lambda: os.getenv(...)`.
2. Document it in `.env.example` with a comment explaining valid values.
3. If the value is used in a tool, thread it through via `config.<section>.<field>` — do not hardcode fallback values in the tool.

---

## CI

Three jobs run on every push:

- **lint** — `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy`
- **test** — `pytest -m unit` with 70% coverage floor
- **sast** — `bandit`, `semgrep`

`ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` resolve most lint issues automatically. For type errors, check that new functions have annotated parameters and return types. For bandit S-rule suppressions, use `# noqa: S<code>` only when the finding is a genuine false positive and add a comment explaining why.
