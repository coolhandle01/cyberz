DNS resolution and subdomain-takeover detection via dnsx.

The OSINT Analyst calls Detect Takeover Candidates to flag subdomains
whose CNAME points to a known-vulnerable provider or whose CNAME chain
dangles (CNAME exists but does not resolve to any A record) - both
classic takeover-vulnerability shapes.

dnsx is the projectdiscovery DNS resolver; install via install-tools.sh.

# Curated subset of the can-i-take-over-xyz catalogue
# (https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz). Each entry maps a
# CNAME suffix to the service it identifies. When the OA's sweep finds a
# subdomain whose CNAME ends in one of these suffixes, the next step is to
# HTTP-probe the host and check for the service-specific "not found" body
# string - if it matches, the subdomain can be claimed by registering on
# the provider.
#
# We intentionally keep this list to widely-encountered, high-confidence
# patterns. Subtle providers that flip vulnerability status frequently
# (e.g. Fastly only with no custom domain claimed) sit at the boundary;
# we include them but the agent should treat the result as a candidate,
# not a confirmation.
