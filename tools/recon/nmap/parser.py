"""Nmap XML output parser.

``_parse_xml(xml_text) -> list[NmapHostResult]`` is the only public
function. Uses ``defusedxml.ElementTree`` (security-hardened parser,
already in the dep chain via the XXE probe) rather than stdlib
``xml.etree`` to avoid XXE / billion-laughs surface.

Defensive throughout - skips hosts / ports / services with mis-shaped
fields rather than failing the whole scan. Real-world runs occasionally
produce truncated output (timeout mid-scan, host going down mid-probe)
and the parser should land what's parseable rather than reject the lot.

Banner strings (service / product / version) are routed through
``coerce_technologies`` so each NmapHostResult arrives with typed
``Technology`` rows alongside its raw services list.
