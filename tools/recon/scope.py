"""Scope filtering for recon results, exposed as Pydantic typed aliases.

The agent-facing surface is four ``Annotated`` types - the LLM picks
targets, and these are the field types that constrain what survives
``args_schema.model_validate(...)``:

- ``TargetHostnames`` - ``list[Hostname]`` that silently drops any
  hostname outside the in-flight programme's scope. Mixed-input
  semantics: the LLM may pass a wider candidate list and only the
  in-scope subset reaches the wrapper body.
- ``TargetEndpoints`` - ``list[Endpoint]`` with the same filter
  semantics, host-extracted from ``Endpoint.url`` via stdlib
  ``urllib.parse.urlparse``.
- ``TargetHostname`` / ``TargetEndpoint`` - single-target variants
  that raise ``ValueError`` on an out-of-scope pick rather than
  silently dropping it. A single target is the LLM committing to one
  address, and a loud reject surfaces the mismatch instead of the run
  going quiet.

Pydantic's ``AfterValidator`` runs as part of every
``args_schema.model_validate(...)`` pass CrewAI does, so the scope guard
is built into the type the LLM sees - no per-tool decorator parameter,
no per-tool body dance. The validator reads ``current_programme()``
(the run-dir Programme snapshot the PM writes at run start); a tool
called without a programme bound raises ``FileNotFoundError`` loudly
rather than running unscoped.

Lower-level helpers (``filter_in_scope`` over a host list,
``host_of`` over a URL string) stay exposed for callers outside the
agent path (the OSINT sweep filters its own discoveries pre-recon).
