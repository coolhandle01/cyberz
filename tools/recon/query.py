"""
tools/recon/query.py - slice a saved AttackSurface without loading it whole.

The Penetration Tester gets a recon.json path from the OSINT Analyst.
Reading the entire file inflates its context with material it does not
need for the next probe (e.g. a 4MB Cloudflare subdomain dump when the
agent only wants to know which endpoints serve WordPress).

Each function reads recon.json, filters, and returns a focused slice -
so the agent can issue a typed query rather than a brute-force read.
