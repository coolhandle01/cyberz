"""
tools/recon/asn.py - bulk IP -> ASN / netblock / RIR-org lookup via
Team Cymru's whois service.

Team Cymru (https://team-cymru.com/community-services/ip-asn-mapping/)
runs a free whois server that answers IP-to-ASN queries at scale. The
bulk protocol takes a newline-delimited list of IPs on stdin and emits
one row per IP carrying the AS number, the announcing BGP prefix
(== netblock), the country code, and the AS organisation name. One
subprocess call returns four amass-asset-types worth of data per IP -
the cheapest possible source for the ASN / Netblock / RIROrganization
layer of the attack surface.

Wire format (response):

    Bulk mode: ...
    AS      | IP               | BGP Prefix      | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
    15169   | 8.8.8.8          | 8.8.8.0/24      | US | arin     | 1992-12-01 | GOOGLE, US
    13335   | 1.1.1.1          | 1.1.1.0/24      | US | arin     | 2010-07-14 | CLOUDFLAREN ET, US

Lines starting with "AS" / non-tabular cruft are skipped. The first
header line carries the column legend; we anchor on it being present
to confirm the response is Cymru's, not someone's misconfigured whois
server.
