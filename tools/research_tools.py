"""
tools/research_tools.py - Attack-plan authoring primitives for the
Vulnerability Researcher.

The VR's research pass turns the OSINT Analyst's recon brief into a typed
attack plan: a list of probe-target hypotheses with expected severity
ceilings and the recon signals that justified each one. The agent does the
thinking; this module provides the supporting primitives:

* ``AttackForest`` / ``AttackTree`` (from ``models.attack``) - the
  artefact the agent composes.
* ``validate_attack_forest(plan)`` - quality gate. Returns the issue list
  (``AttackForestValidationReport`` from ``models.attack``). Hard errors
  block ``finalise_research``.
* ``finalise_research(plan)`` - validate, persist ``attack_forest.json`` for
  the Penetration Tester and re-read at triage time. Raises
  ``AttackForestFinalisationError`` (from ``models.attack``) on hard errors.
* ``load_attack_forest(path)`` - reverse direction. Deserialise
  ``attack_forest.json`` into a typed ``AttackForest`` so downstream agents
  (PT, VR at triage) consume a Pydantic model rather than a raw blob.

Mirrors the ``finalise_recon`` / ``finalise_triage`` pattern so the VR's
research artefact is a first-class workspace file alongside ``recon.json``
and ``verified.json``.
