"""
tools/recon_insights.py - Host-annotation authoring primitives for the OSINT
Analyst.

The OA's job is to turn the raw sweep (subfinder + httpx + nmap + dirfuzz +
TLS / DNS checks) into a curated attack-surface map: every interesting host
labelled with a role (admin / api / auth / app / cdn / ...), a priority
(high / medium / low / skip), tech detected with versions where possible, and
free-text notes that tell the Vulnerability Researcher WHY this host warrants
attention. The agent does the curation; this module provides the supporting
primitives:

* ``HostInsight`` (from ``models``) - the agent's working artefact per host.
* ``validate_insight(insight, sweep, programme)`` - quality gate. Returns the
  issue list. Hard errors block ``finalise_recon``.
* ``host_dir(fqdn)`` - the per-host evidence directory under
  ``<run_dir>/assets/<fqdn>/``. Future recon tools (screenshots, scan
  output, response bodies) write per-host artefacts here so each
  directory carries one FQDN asset's worth of evidence end-to-end.
* ``save_insight`` / ``load_insights`` - persist insights under
  ``<run_dir>/assets/<fqdn>/insight.json``.
* ``finalise_recon(programme, attack_graph_path)`` - load the sweep, validate every
  insight, build the canonical ``AttackGraph`` for downstream agents, and
  write ``recon.json``. Refuses on hard errors or insufficient curation.

The OA's initial sweep is written to ``attack_graph.json``; ``finalise_recon``
copies the inventory through, attaches insights, and emits the final
``recon.json`` that the Vulnerability Researcher and Penetration Tester
consume.
