"""
tools/research_vocab.py - Extension-point registries for the Vulnerability
Researcher's ``Finalise Research`` tool docstring.

The agent that drafts the attack plan sees four pieces of vocabulary in
the tool's docstring:

* PROBE_VOCABULARY - the canonical name-shapes a ``probe`` field can take.
* RECON_EVIDENCE_KINDS - the kinds of recon signal the agent should cite
  in ``recon_evidence``.
* Framework vocabulary - the typed ``Framework`` members the agent may
  cite in ``recon_evidence`` ("framework=django") or in ``rationale``.
* Cloud vocabulary - the typed ``Cloud`` members the agent may cite the
  same way ("cloud=aws").

All four are composed into the tool's docstring by ``research_brief_tool``
in ``squad/vulnerability_researcher/__init__.py`` at decoration time,
mirroring the way ``pentest_tool`` weaves OWASP categories from ``@owasp``
into the agent-visible docstring of each pentest tool.

Append-only contract. When a new exploit family lands (issue #88, the typed
``Exploit`` interface), append each canonical ``Exploit.name`` to
PROBE_VOCABULARY. When ReconResult grows new evidence-bearing fields (issue
#45, OWASP Amass adds ASN/CIDR), append the new kinds to
RECON_EVIDENCE_KINDS. Framework and Cloud vocabularies are read live from
the ``Framework`` / ``Cloud`` StrEnums - new enum members appear in the
docstring automatically.
