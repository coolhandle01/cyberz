"""
tools/owasp_data.py - local OWASP Cheat Sheet catalogue.

The Cheat Sheet Series at https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org publishes
canonical mitigation guidance keyed by URL slug. The Technical Author cites
these in the Remediation section of every disclosure; this module is the
single source of truth for those slugs and a short summary so the agent does
not have to remember (or worse, hallucinate) URLs.

Entries are looked up by case-insensitive substring match against the topic
slug or title. The CWE catalogue cross-references this module via
``owasp_topic`` so a CWE lookup hands the agent the matching cheat-sheet URL
in one hop.
