tools/workspace/ - read-only access to the per-run shared workspace.

Agents pass artefact basenames through their task context (recon.json,
findings.json, verified.json, ...). These helpers let any agent list and
read those files on demand.

The API is deliberately narrow: inputs are paths *relative to* the run
directory, full stop. No absolute paths, no parent traversal. The shape
itself communicates the contract; we are not in the business of providing
arbitrary-read primitives to LLM-driven agents.
