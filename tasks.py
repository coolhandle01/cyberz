"""
tasks.py - Pipeline task wiring.

Context chaining lives here because it is a pipeline concern, not a per-member one.

human_input=True on a task tells CrewAI to pause after the agent finishes and
prompt the operator for feedback before advancing. Empty feedback (Enter) accepts
the result; typed feedback re-invokes the agent with that guidance.

Set CYBERSQUAD_HUMAN_INPUT=false to disable all gates for unattended runs.
