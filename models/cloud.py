"""
models/cloud.py - typed shape for cloud providers the squad targets.

The ``Cloud`` StrEnum is the canonical vocabulary the recon pass cites,
the Vulnerability Researcher references in an attack plan, and the
provider-specific cloud probes stamp via ``@cloud(...)`` from
``tools/pentest/cloud.py``. Sibling to ``models/framework.py`` - the
two enums together carry the asset-property vocabulary the agent
navigates.

Lives in ``models/`` (rather than next to its decorator in
``tools/pentest/cloud.py``) for the same reason ``Framework`` does:
the enum is read across the recon -> VR -> PT boundary, not only by
the decorator that stamps it.
