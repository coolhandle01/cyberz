models.asset.url - the OAM ``URL`` asset (a structured, parsed URL).

The addressable *identity* of a URL, broken into scheme / host / port / path /
... - what amass's OAM ``URL`` asset carries. Distinct from ``Endpoint`` (the
sibling module): ``Endpoint`` is a recon *observation* (a URL string plus the
status / technologies / TLS / vulns httpx saw), whereas ``Url`` is the OAM
*asset* - just the identity, with the observations hung off it as properties /
relations when #45 lands.

    """The cybersquad shape that maps to amass's OAM ``URL`` asset.

    A structured, parsed URL - the asset identity, not an opaque string.
    Mirrors amass's ``URL`` field for field (OAM json tag in parentheses):

    * ``raw`` (``url``) -> the raw, unprocessed URL.
    * ``scheme`` (``scheme``) -> http / https / ...
    * ``username`` / ``password`` (``username`` / ``password``) -> userinfo
      credentials embedded in the URL (see the SECURITY note below).
    * ``host`` (``host``) -> the host component (FQDN or IP literal).
    * ``port`` (``port``) -> the port, ``None`` when the URL omits it.
    * ``path`` (``path``) -> the path component.
    * ``options`` (``options``) -> the query string / connect options.
    * ``fragment`` (``fragment``) -> the URI fragment.

    ``host`` is a bare ``str`` (not the ``FQDN`` primitive) on purpose: a URL
    host is legitimately an IPv4 / IPv6 / IDN-punycode literal as well as an
    FQDN, and OAM keeps it an open string - the parse that produced these
    components already validated the shape upstream.
