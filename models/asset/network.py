models.asset.network - typed shapes for the OAM registrant / network assets
of an attack surface.

Sits between ``models.primitives.IPAddress`` (the typed address) and
``models.asset`` (the FQDN / Endpoint layer agents reason about). The
data here is what Team Cymru bulk-whois, RDAP lookups, and (eventually)
amass's graph emit about the IP-layer ownership of an asset.

Mid-migration to the faithful per-OAM-type modules: the faithful
``AutonomousSystem`` and ``Netblock`` assets live here now. The legacy
cybersquad compositions (``AsnRecord`` / ``Contact`` / ``ContactRole`` /
``RdapRecord``) remain until the recon producers are rewired onto the
faithful assets (in ``registration`` / ``org`` / ``contact`` / ``people`` /
``identifier``) plus ``Relation`` edges - then they are removed.

OAM assets:
* ``AutonomousSystem``
  <https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open_asset_model/assets/autonomous_system/>
* ``Netblock`` <https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open_asset_model/assets/netblock/>

``RdapRecord`` is the structured-registrant sibling of ``AsnRecord``.
RFC 7483 / RDAP gives us per-field registrant_organisation /
abuse_email / registered_at / last_changed_at rather than Cymru's
single stringly-typed organisation field. Each field becomes a separate
amass ``SimpleProperty`` on the ``RIROrganization`` asset; the agent
reads them individually rather than parsing a concatenation. The
``RdapRecord`` here is the runtime in-memory shape; the
``RIROrganization`` properties at amass-write time are the persisted
shape. Two layers, one record.

Distinct from ``models/scanner.py`` - that file carries the CLI
scanner config (NmapMode / HttpxMode / scan-result shapes). This file
describes the asset; ``scanner.py`` describes the scan.
