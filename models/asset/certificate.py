class TLSCertificate(BaseModel):
    """The cybersquad shape that maps to amass's ``TLSCertificate`` asset.

    One X.509 leaf certificate as observed on a host's HTTPS service -
    what httpx's ``-tls-grab`` and testssl.sh surface during the OSINT
    Analyst's sweep. Today only the SAN list is harvested (into
    ``Endpoint.tls_sans``, for in-scope-FQDN discovery) and posture
    problems become ``RawFinding`` rows; the cert itself is never
    persisted as an asset. This model is that asset node.

    Carries the cert's *identity and properties*, not its posture:
    subject / issuer / serial / fingerprint / validity window / SANs.
    Posture judgements (self-signed, expired, weak cipher) stay in the
    testssl ``RawFinding`` path - this shape answers "what cert is
    this", the findings answer "what is wrong with it".

    When amass lands (#45), each ``TLSCertificate`` becomes one amass
    ``TLSCertificate`` asset node:

    * ``fingerprint_sha256`` / ``serial`` -> the node's stable identity
      and the natural join key for a Censys / Shodan ``cert hash`` pivot.
    * ``subject_common_name`` / ``issuer`` / ``not_before`` /
      ``not_after`` -> ``SimpleProperty`` values on the node.
    * ``subject_alt_names`` -> ``SAN_FOR`` edges to the ``FQDN`` assets
      the cert vouches for; a multi-SAN cert is the densest single-asset
      FQDN-discovery surface recon produces.
    * ``host`` -> the edge back to the ``FQDN`` / ``IPAddress`` the cert
      was observed on (provenance), mirroring ``Service.host``.

    All fields beyond ``host`` default to None / empty - a cert is
    useful with whatever subset the grab recovered.
