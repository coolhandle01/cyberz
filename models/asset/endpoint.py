models.asset.endpoint - discovered HTTP/S endpoints and the LLM-endpoint marker.

The recon-discovery shapes the OSINT Analyst's httpx pass produces, plus the
paginated slice the recon query tools return.

``Endpoint`` is a cybersquad recon *observation*, not an OAM asset type: the
OAM asset for a web address is ``URL`` (modelled in ``models.asset.url``), and
the status / tech / TLS / vulns an ``Endpoint`` carries become properties hung
off that ``URL`` when #45 lands.

    ``url`` is validated through Pydantic's built-in ``HttpUrl``
    (canonical RFC-3986 parser) with the host component running through
    the ``FQDN`` validator for RFC 1123 strictness; runtime stays
    ``str`` so consumers that ``.startswith(...)`` / ``.lower()`` /
    ``urlparse(ep.url)`` / dict-key / f-string keep working with no
    audit. See ``models/primitives._validate_endpoint_url`` for the
    full contract.

    ``technologies`` is the raw httpx ``-tech-detect`` output

    tool's own vocabulary, kept verbatim. We classify nothing and
    maintain no catalogue: the tool's string is the identifier. The
    raw strings populate at probe time in ``tools.recon.httpx.httpx_scan``.

    (Web technologies carry no CPE - httpx emits names, not CPEs - so
    they stay as strings here. nmap-discovered services carry their
    NIST CPE on the ``Service`` asset instead.)

    FIXME(#144 / #83): this class is on the way to becoming ``DiscoveredMCP``.
    The intent the original author was reaching for - "this endpoint
    exposes an LLM" - has a more useful concrete shape now that the MCP
    threat model is clear: MCP servers advertise tool lists, capability
    bits, init handshakes, and schemas, and that structured surface is
    what the PT would actually probe against. The right move is to
    promote this into ``models/framework.py`` (per #83) as
    ``DiscoveredMCP`` carrying the advertised tool inventory, the
    suspicious-docstring flags, and the schema-laxness markers that the
    #144 MCP-discipline conversation called out. Until then this class
    exists as an intent marker and a placeholder; do not extend it as a
    generic LLM endpoint shape.
