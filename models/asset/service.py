"""
models.asset.service - the OAM ``Service`` / ``Product`` / ``ProductRelease``
assets.

The OAM ``Service`` asset the OA's deep-scan pass emits, plus the product
line and version-specific release the ``product_used`` edge points at (and
the spec-proper anchor a ``VulnProperty`` hangs off).

OAM assets (modelled field-for-field):
* ``Service`` <https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open_asset_model/assets/service/>
* ``Product`` <https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open_asset_model/assets/product/>
* ``ProductRelease``
  <https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open_asset_model/assets/product_release/>

nmap's host:port becomes the ``port`` relation (host -> Service) and its CPE
is decomposed into ``Product`` / ``ProductRelease`` assets linked by a
``product_used`` relation - none of that lives on the ``Service`` struct,
faithful to OAM. The decomposition runs in ``tools/recon/nmap/service.py``.

    """The cybersquad shape that maps to amass's OAM ``Service`` asset.

    One network-accessible service the OSINT Analyst's deep-scan pass (a
    focused nmap ``-sV`` against a host's open ports) observed. Mirrors
    amass's ``Service`` field for field (OAM json tag in parentheses):

    * ``id`` (``unique_id``) -> the service's stable identity. cybersquad
      synthesises it as ``<host>:<port>/<protocol>``.
    * ``type`` (``service_type``) -> the service kind nmap named ("http",
      "ssh", ...).
    * ``output`` (``output``) -> the service-detection banner text.
    * ``output_length`` (``output_length``) -> ``len(output)``.
    * ``attributes`` (``attributes``) -> the remaining nmap banner fields as
      a key -> values map (``product`` / ``version`` / ``cpe``).

    The service's host:port is *not* a field - it is the ``port`` relation
    (host -> Service) in ``relations.json``. The product / version / CPE are
    not fields either - nmap's CPE is decomposed into ``Product`` /
    ``ProductRelease`` assets linked by a ``product_used`` relation, and the
    CPE keys the CVE lookup whose ``VulnProperty`` results hang off the
    release; ``attributes`` keeps the raw nmap values for provenance.

    OAM is a *presence* graph: a ``Service`` exists only where the scan
    observed an open service - a filtered / closed port is absence, not a
    node.
