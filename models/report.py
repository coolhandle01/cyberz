models/report.py - typed shape for the Technical Author's drafted
report content.

Carries the LLM-authored prose (``AuthoredDraft``) the agent fills
in to draft a vulnerability report for one verified finding. The
full ``ReportDraft`` record - which merges the LLM-authored prose
with carry-forward fields from the VR's verified finding - lives next
to the report-persistence logic in ``tools/report_tools.py``.

Lives in models/ rather than tools/ because ``AuthoredDraft`` is the
contract the LLM sees as the args_schema of ``Draft Vulnerability
Report``: every field carries a ``Field(description=...)`` because
the per-field description is what teaches the agent the report
quality gate's grammar.
