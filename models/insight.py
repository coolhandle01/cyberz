"""
models/insight.py - typed shapes for the OSINT Analyst's recon curation
and finalisation pipeline.

The OA's curation layer - its *judgements* about the asset graph, not OAM
asset types (those live in ``models/asset/``):

* the host-classification enums (``HostRole`` / ``HostPriority``),
* the per-host annotation the agent authors (``HostInsight``) and its
  machine-actionable score half (``HostScore``),
* the host-keyed port map the Penetration Tester reads (``OpenPortsMap``),
* the ``Annotate Host`` return shape (``HostAnnotation``),
* the quality-gate validation report (``InsightValidationIssue`` /
  ``InsightValidationReport``) the OA's ``Annotate Host`` tool produces,
* and the ``ReconFinalisationError`` ``finalise_recon`` raises when the
  sweep + per-host insights cannot be consolidated into ``recon.json``.

Lives in models/ rather than tools/ because these are typed contracts the
OA wrapper functions return / raise - the kind of shape consumers import to
type-check against rather than to invoke. The data (sweep loaders, insight
persistence, scope guards) stays in ``tools/recon_insights.py``.
