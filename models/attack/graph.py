models.attack.graph - the OSINT Analyst's recon-output bundle.

The Sheyner-style attack graph: everything the OA *describes* about a
programme's attack surface, composing the OAM asset shapes from
``models.asset``. Not itself an OAM asset - the bundle that wraps them, the
root of the OA -> VR -> PT handoff.
