The Schneier-1999 attack tree: a goal (probe + target) the Penetration Tester
searches for. The trees the VR *finds* on the OA's ``AttackGraph``; collected
into an ``AttackForest`` (the sibling module) the PT then searches.

    forward-looking: once the VR starts emitting AND/OR subgoal
    decomposition ("RCE on api.example.com" -OR-> "SSRF -> internal

    probes succeed or fail).
