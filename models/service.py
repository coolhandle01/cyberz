"""
models/service.py - typed shape for named exposed services / products the
squad probes.

The ``Service`` StrEnum is the third asset-property vocabulary alongside
``Framework`` (web app stacks) and ``Cloud`` (cloud providers at the
provider level). It carries the long tail of named products that have
their own targeted probe: databases (Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ...),
dashboards (Grafana, Kibana, Portainer), control panels (cPanel, Plesk,
DirectAdmin, Webmin), and service-discovery systems (Consul, Vault).

Why a third enum rather than widening ``Framework`` to include all of
these: Django is a web framework; Redis is a database; cPanel is a
control panel. Different mental models. Keeping the three vocabularies
separate lets the agent reason about each axis independently - "the
target is a Spring web app fronted by Grafana on AWS" decomposes
cleanly into ``Framework.spring``, ``Service.grafana``, ``Cloud.aws``
without overloading any one enum.

Lives in ``models/`` (rather than next to its decorator in
``tools/pentest/service.py``) for the same reason ``Framework`` and
``Cloud`` do: the enum is read across the recon -> VR -> PT boundary,
not only by the decorator that stamps it.
