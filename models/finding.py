"""
models.finding - the vuln-pipeline data shapes (PT -> VR -> TA).

``RawFinding`` is the unverified output of an automated probe;
``VerifiedVulnerability`` is the post-triage shape the Technical Author
turns into a report; ``RawFindingSummary`` is the compact slice the VR's
List Raw Findings tool returns. All three carry a ``Severity`` (from
``models.primitives``).
