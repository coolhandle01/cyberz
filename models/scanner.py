models/scanner.py - typed shapes for CLI-scanner config + results.

Carries the agent-facing knobs the OA picks per invocation (modes,
banner depth, NSE script bundles) and the result-of-a-scan shapes
those invocations emit. Distinct from ``models/network.py`` which
holds asset-layer network properties (ASN / Netblock / RIR Org /
future RDAP) - that file describes the asset, this file describes
the scan.

Both nmap and httpx live here. Future amass-tool wrappers and any
later CLI binary the OA reaches for (naabu, wafw00f, gowitness)
add their shape here too. The pattern they share: a Mode enum the
agent reasons in, a Result model the agent reads back, optional
evidence-path field for things written to ``runtime.run_dir()``.
